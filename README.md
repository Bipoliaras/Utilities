# Utilities [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Samasaur1/Utilities.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/Samasaur1/Utilities) [![](https://jitpack.io/v/Samasaur1/Utilities.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#Samasaur1/Utilities)
A collection of Java utilities

## Installation
If you use Gradle, Maven, SBT, or Leiningen, follow [this](https://jitpack.io/#Samasaur1/Utilities) guide.

Ant is also supported but does not have a guide.

If you want to download the library manually, head on over to the [Releases page](https://github.com/Samasaur1/Utilities/releases) and download the latest release.

## Implementation
Import `com.gauck.sam.Utilities.*;`

The main `Utilities` class should be used similarly to `java.lang.Math`. This means that users should call its static methods and not try to instantiate.
